About
-----

This repo serves as a holding area for information on bioinformatics tools commonly used by the lab. These pages are poweruser oriented; they are not meant to be exhaustive tutorials, but rather a way for us to share our use cases and parameters internally. The preferred format for each page is as follows:

* tool name and version
* link to tool webpage and/or paper
* in general, what does it do?
* what is its availability -- is it on the hpcc or athyra?
* your common use case (and also, who are you?)
* parameters, and short justification for parameters
* common pitfalls, if any (for example, outputs ten files, which one matters?)
* hand-wavey performance estimate, if necessary (if you really grok the tool, use big-O notation)
* example shell use
